# Write a Python program that will tell you how old you will be on your next birthday.
# Your program should:
#  • prompt you to enter your age
#  • add 1 to the entered age
#  • output your age on your next birthday.
# You should use meaningful variable name(s), correct syntax and indentation in your answer.

currentAge = int(input("Enter your current age: ")) # Include correct data types - integer required.
print(str(currentAge + 1) + " is how old you will be on your next birthday.")
